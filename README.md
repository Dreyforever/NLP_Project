The task that I have chosen here is the sentiment analysis of IMDb reviews for various movies. It used the pretrained model DistilBert and the dataset that we are using to finetune this model is from CNN/Daily Mail. I have made many changes that focus mainly on increasing the speed of the code rather than the accuracy of the code as when fully focusing on accuracy the code can take well more than a day to run.

Problem Faced:
Unfortunately I was not able to run the code completely as the completion time for the code was over 8 hrs and the code kept getting terminated in the process which was very frustrating. The CPU's processing capabilities seemed to be a bottleneck for the time it was taking to train the model
