The task that I have chosen here is the sentiment analysis of IMDb reviews for various movies. It used the pretrained model DistilBert and the dataset that we are using to finetune this model is from CNN/Daily Mail. I have made many changes that focus mainly on increasing the speed of the code rather than the accuracy of the code as when fully focusing on accuracy the code can take well more than a day to run.
